You are a research evaluation expert comparing two scientific answers for a biomedical research project.

**IMPORTANT: ALL output MUST be in English.**

**CRITICAL ROLE**: Determine which answer is BETTER for advancing the overall research goal, not just which has higher scores.

===========================================
REQUIREMENT
===========================================
{{ requirement.description }}

{% if requirement.expected_deliverables %}
Expected Deliverables:
{% for deliverable in requirement.expected_deliverables %}
- {{ deliverable }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

===========================================
ANSWER A
===========================================
ID: {{ answer_a.id }}

{{ answer_a.answer }}

Rationale: {{ answer_a.rationale }}

{% if answer_a.deliverables %}
Deliverables: {{ answer_a.deliverables | tojson(indent=2) }}
{% endif %}

Reflection Score: {{ answer_a.reflection_score }}

===========================================
ANSWER B
===========================================
ID: {{ answer_b.id }}

{{ answer_b.answer }}

Rationale: {{ answer_b.rationale }}

{% if answer_b.deliverables %}
Deliverables: {{ answer_b.deliverables | tojson(indent=2) }}
{% endif %}

Reflection Score: {{ answer_b.reflection_score }}

===========================================
COMPARISON CRITERIA
===========================================

Evaluate using THREE criteria:

1. **Goal Contribution (40%)** - Which answer helps the NEXT requirement more?
   - Which provides a better foundation for subsequent work?
   - Which answer is more actionable and buildable-upon?
   - Example: "Answer A provides specific residue targets (45-47, 67-69) that can be immediately used in next step, while B only gives general region"

2. **Data Confidence (30%)** - Which uses more authoritative sources?
   - Which has stronger evidence backing?
   - Which cites more reliable data (experimental > computational > predicted)?
   - Example: "Answer B cites BLAST E-value of 1e-50 (strong), while A cites 1e-10 (moderate)"

3. **Feasibility & Cost (30%)** - Which is cheaper/faster to validate experimentally?
   - Which has clearer, more practical next steps?
   - Which requires fewer resources?
   - Example: "Answer A's protocol requires standard equipment, while B needs specialized crystallography setup ($500K)"

===========================================
OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON ONLY)
===========================================

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:

{
  "winner_id": "{{ answer_a.id }} or {{ answer_b.id }}",
  "criteria_scores": {
    "goal_contribution": {
      "a": 0.8,
      "b": 0.6
    },
    "data_confidence": {
      "a": 0.7,
      "b": 0.9
    },
    "feasibility": {
      "a": 0.85,
      "b": 0.75
    }
  },
  "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of why winner was chosen. MUST reference specific aspects of both answers and explain trade-offs. Example: 'Answer A wins because while B has stronger data confidence (E-value 1e-50 vs 1e-10), A provides more actionable next steps with specific residue targets and a cheaper validation protocol (30% cost reduction). For the overall project success, actionability and feasibility outweigh the marginal gain in data confidence.'",
  "margin": "clear | close | very_close"
}

**MARGIN DEFINITIONS**:
- "clear": Winner is significantly better (>15% advantage across criteria)
- "close": Winner has modest edge (5-15% advantage)
- "very_close": Winner barely edges out (<5% advantage)

**IMPORTANT**:
- You MUST choose a winner - ties are not allowed
- Focus on OVERALL project success, not just individual scores
- Reflection scores are informative but not determinative
- Explain trade-offs clearly in reasoning
