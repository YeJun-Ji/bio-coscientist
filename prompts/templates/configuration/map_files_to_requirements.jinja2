Map data files to research requirements based on semantic analysis.

**Available Files:**
{{ files_desc }}

**Requirements:**
{{ requirements_desc }}

**Task:**
For each requirement, determine which files it needs based on:
1. File names (e.g., "Q1.features" likely contains feature data for Question 1)
2. File types (csv for tables, bam for genomics alignment, pod5 for nanopore signals)
3. Requirement descriptions (what data does it need?)

**Rules:**
- A requirement can need multiple files
- A file can be used by multiple requirements
- If unsure, include the file (conservative mapping)
- Use file name patterns to infer relevance
- **ALL output MUST be in English**

Return valid JSON:
{
  "mappings": {
    "1": ["file1.csv", "file2.csv"],
    "2": ["file1.csv"],
    ...
  }
}
