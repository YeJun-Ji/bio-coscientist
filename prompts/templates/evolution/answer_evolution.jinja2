You are a computational biology expert improving an existing research answer through evolution.
Your task is to create an IMPROVED version of the parent answer using the specified evolution method.

=== RESEARCH CONTEXT ===

**Problem Title**: {{ parsed_problem.title|default("Research Problem") }}

**Background**:
{{ parsed_problem.background|default("")|truncate(1000) }}

=== REQUIREMENT ===

**Requirement {{ requirement.requirement_id|default(requirement.step_id|default("")) }}: {{ requirement.title|default("") }}**

{% if requirement.description %}
**Description**: {{ requirement.description }}
{% endif %}

{% if requirement.expected_deliverables %}
**Expected Deliverables**:
{% for deliverable in requirement.expected_deliverables %}
- {{ deliverable }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

=== PARENT ANSWER TO EVOLVE ===

**Answer ID**: {{ parent_answer.id }}

**Current Answer**:
{{ parent_answer.answer }}

**Current Rationale**:
{{ parent_answer.rationale }}

**Current Deliverables**:
{{ parent_answer.deliverables|tojson(indent=2) }}

{% if parent_answer.review_weaknesses %}
**Known Weaknesses (from review)**:
{% for weakness in parent_answer.review_weaknesses %}
- {{ weakness }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if context %}
=== CONFIRMED CONTEXT (Dependencies) ===

Your improved answer MUST remain consistent with these confirmed answers:

{% for dep_id, dep_data in context.items() %}
**Requirement {{ dep_id }}**: {{ dep_data.answer }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

=== EVOLUTION METHOD: {{ evolution_method|upper }} ===

{% if evolution_method == "grounding" %}
**GROUNDING EVOLUTION**
Focus: {{ focus|default("Add more specific details and concrete values") }}

Improve the answer by:
- Adding more specific, concrete details (exact values, sequences, methods)
- Reducing vagueness and generality
- Strengthening the scientific foundation
{% elif evolution_method == "coherence" %}
**COHERENCE EVOLUTION**
Focus: {{ focus|default("Improve alignment with confirmed context and strengthen logical connections") }}

Improve the answer by:
- Better aligning with confirmed dependency answers
- Strengthening logical connections and flow
- Ensuring consistent terminology
- Improving narrative coherence
{% elif evolution_method == "simplification" %}
**SIMPLIFICATION EVOLUTION**
Focus: {{ focus|default("Remove unnecessary complexity while maintaining scientific rigor") }}

Improve the answer by:
- Removing unnecessary complexity
- Focusing on core elements
- Making deliverables more achievable
- Improving clarity without losing substance
{% elif evolution_method == "divergent" %}
**DIVERGENT EVOLUTION**
Focus: {{ focus|default("Explore an alternative approach while remaining scientifically valid") }}

Improve the answer by:
- Exploring alternative approaches or methodologies
- Considering different perspectives
- Challenging assumptions
- Proposing innovative solutions
{% else %}
**GENERAL EVOLUTION**
Focus: {{ focus|default("Overall improvement") }}

Improve the answer by addressing weaknesses and strengthening quality.
{% endif %}

=== YOUR TASK ===

Create an EVOLVED version that is demonstrably better than the parent.

**Requirements:**
1. MUST address known weaknesses (if any)
2. MUST maintain consistency with confirmed context
3. MUST provide ALL expected deliverables
4. Should show CLEAR improvement over parent
5. MUST explain what specific improvements were made
6. Keep response CONCISE - improvements should be 3-5 items, each under 200 chars

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

Respond with valid JSON only:

```json
{
  "requirement_id": "{{ requirement.requirement_id|default(requirement.step_id|default('')) }}",
  "evolution_method": "{{ evolution_method }}",

  "improvements": [
    "Specific improvement 1: what was changed and why (max 200 chars)",
    "Specific improvement 2: what was changed and why (max 200 chars)",
    "... (3-5 improvements total, keep each concise)"
  ],

  "answer": "Evolved detailed answer (4-8 sentences). Must be demonstrably better than parent.",

  "rationale": "Improved scientific reasoning (3-4 sentences)",

  "deliverables": {
    {% for deliverable in requirement.expected_deliverables|default([]) %}
    "{{ deliverable|lower|replace(' ', '_')|replace('-', '_') }}": "Improved output for: {{ deliverable }}"{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
  },

  "confidence": 0.75,

  "comparison_to_parent": "2-3 sentence explanation of why this evolved answer is better than the parent"
}
```

=== QUALITY CHECKLIST ===

Before finalizing:
- [ ] Addresses all known weaknesses from review
- [ ] Consistent with confirmed context
- [ ] Provides ALL expected deliverables
- [ ] More specific than parent (for grounding)
- [ ] Better aligned with context (for coherence)
- [ ] Clearer and simpler (for simplification)
- [ ] Novel approach explored (for divergent)
- [ ] Clear improvements articulated
