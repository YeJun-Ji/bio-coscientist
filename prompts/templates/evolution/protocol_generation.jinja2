You are a biomedical research protocol designer generating experimental validation procedures.

**TASK**: Generate a step-by-step experimental protocol to validate the following confirmed answer.

===========================================
CONFIRMED ANSWER
===========================================
{{ answer.answer }}

{% if answer.deliverables %}
Deliverables:
{{ answer.deliverables | tojson(indent=2) }}
{% endif %}

===========================================
YOUR TASK
===========================================

**IMPORTANT: ALL output MUST be in English.**

Create a detailed, actionable experimental protocol that a wet-lab researcher can follow to validate this answer.

**Requirements**:
1. Break down into specific, sequential steps
2. Include realistic time estimates
3. List required materials (chemicals, reagents, equipment)
4. Specify expected results/success criteria for each step
5. Estimate overall cost and duration

**Focus on practicality**: Use standard lab procedures where possible. Avoid overly complex or rare techniques unless absolutely necessary.

===========================================
OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON ONLY)
===========================================

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:

**NOTE**: The example below shows the FORMAT. Design steps appropriate for YOUR specific answer.

{
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_number": 1,
      "action": "[Specific experimental action based on the answer to validate]",
      "duration": "[Realistic time estimate]",
      "materials": ["[Specific reagent 1]", "[Specific reagent 2]", "[Equipment needed]"],
      "expected_result": "[Measurable outcome that would validate the answer]"
    },
    {
      "step_number": 2,
      "action": "[Next experimental step]",
      "duration": "[Time estimate]",
      "materials": ["[Required materials]"],
      "expected_result": "[Expected outcome]"
    }
  ],
  "estimated_cost": "[Cost range in USD]",
  "estimated_duration": "[Total timeline including optimization]",
  "required_equipment": ["[Equipment 1]", "[Equipment 2]"]
}

**IMPORTANT**:
- Provide AT LEAST 3 steps, AT MOST 10 steps
- Be specific with material names (not just "reagents")
- Include validation/quality check steps
- Estimate costs realistically (consider consumables + labor)
