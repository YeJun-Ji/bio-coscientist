YOUR TASK
===========================================

**IMPORTANT: ALL output MUST be in English.**

Identify risks across three categories:

1. **Technical Risks** - Lab/experimental challenges
   - Example: Low protein expression yield, equipment malfunction, assay sensitivity

2. **Biological Risks** - Biological system uncertainties
   - Example: Off-target binding, unexpected toxicity, species-specific differences

3. **Validation Risks** - Challenges in confirming results
   - Example: Insufficient statistical power, reproducibility issues, long timelines

For each risk:
- Assess likelihood (low/medium/high)
- Assess impact (low/medium/high)
- Propose specific mitigation strategy with evidence-based effectiveness estimate

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:

{
  "risks": [
    {
      "type": "technical",
      "description": "Protein aggregation during expression due to hydrophobic regions",
      "likelihood": "medium",
      "impact": "high"
    },
    {
      "type": "biological",
      "description": "Off-target binding to TNFR2 due to sequence similarity (42% homology)",
      "likelihood": "high",
      "impact": "medium"
    }
  ],
  "mitigation_strategies": [
    {
      "for_risk": "Protein aggregation during expression",
      "strategy": "Use fusion tags (MBP or SUMO) to improve solubility, express at lower temperature (16°C)",
      "effectiveness": "Proven effective in 80% of cases for hydrophobic proteins (Smith et al. 2020)"
    },
    {
      "for_risk": "Off-target binding to TNFR2",
      "strategy": "Include competitive binding assay with TNFR2, use selective inhibitors to block cross-reactivity",
      "effectiveness": "Selectivity assays can distinguish >10-fold binding differences (Jones et al. 2019)"
    }
  ],
  "overall_risk_level": "low | medium | high"
}

**RISK LEVEL MATRIX**:
```
           Impact
         L   M   H
    L  low  low  med
Lik M  low  med  high
    H  med  high high
```

**OVERALL RISK ASSESSMENT**:
- **low**: Most risks are low-medium, mitigation strategies proven
- **medium**: Some high-impact risks, but mitigation available
- **high**: Multiple high-likelihood + high-impact risks, limited mitigation

**IMPORTANT**:
- Identify AT LEAST 2 risks, AT MOST 6 risks
- Every risk MUST have a corresponding mitigation strategy
- Mitigation effectiveness should cite evidence when possible (e.g., "80% success rate in literature")
- Be realistic - don't catastrophize, but don't downplay serious issues
