=== YOUR TASK ===

Evaluate the **QUALITY** of this answer using domain-agnostic criteria.

Focus on THREE dimensions:

**1. LOGICAL CONSISTENCY (40%)**

Evaluate:
- Does the reasoning flow logically from evidence to conclusions?
- Are all claims supported by the data/evidence presented?
- Are there any internal contradictions or logical gaps?
- Does the answer properly distinguish between:
  * **Observations**: Direct facts from data (e.g., "Tool X produced value Y")
  * **Inferences**: Conclusions drawn from observations (e.g., "This suggests Z")

Avoid:
- DO NOT check tool-specific thresholds (verification already did that)
- DO NOT penalize for missing tools (coverage already checked)
- Focus ONLY on the logic: evidence → reasoning → conclusion

Red flags:
- Claims that don't follow from evidence
- Contradicting oneself
- Confusing observation with speculation

**2. CLARITY (30%)**

Evaluate:
- Is the answer clearly structured and easy to understand?
- Are technical terms used appropriately and explained when necessary?
- Can an expert in the field understand what was done and why?
- Is the presentation organized logically?

Avoid:
- DO NOT penalize for using domain-specific terminology (that's appropriate)
- DO NOT require excessive detail for straightforward cases

Red flags:
- Vague or ambiguous statements
- Unclear what was actually done
- Missing key information needed to understand the answer

**3. ACTIONABILITY (30%)**

Evaluate:
- Does the answer provide concrete, usable deliverables?
- Are next steps clear (if applicable)?
- Is uncertainty communicated appropriately?
- Can someone act on this information?

Avoid:
- DO NOT require next steps if the requirement is complete
- DO NOT penalize for appropriate expressions of uncertainty

Red flags:
- Vague recommendations with no specifics
- Missing critical deliverables
- Over-confident claims without acknowledging limitations

=== CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS ===

**DO NOT**:
- Apply tool-specific threshold checks (e.g., "E-value should be < 1e-5")
  → Verification already did this objectively
- Penalize for tool selection (that's not your job)
- Check data accuracy (verification already confirmed it)

**DO**:
- Evaluate the logic and flow of reasoning
- Assess clarity and communication quality
- Check if deliverables are concrete and usable
- Consider how well the answer addresses the requirement

Think of it this way:
- Verification checked if the FACTS are correct
- You check if the ANSWER is GOOD (well-reasoned, clear, useful)

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

Respond with valid JSON ONLY (no markdown, no extra text):

```json
{
  "quality_score": <float 0.0-1.0>,

  "dimensions": {
    "logical_consistency": {
      "score": <float 0.0-1.0>,
      "feedback": "<2-3 sentences explaining the score>"
    },
    "clarity": {
      "score": <float 0.0-1.0>,
      "feedback": "<2-3 sentences explaining the score>"
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": <float 0.0-1.0>,
      "feedback": "<2-3 sentences explaining the score>"
    }
  },

  "overall_feedback": "<2-3 sentences summarizing the answer's quality>",

  "strengths": [
    "<specific strength 1>",
    "<specific strength 2>"
  ],

  "weaknesses": [
    "<specific weakness 1>",
    "<specific weakness 2>"
  ]
}
```

**Score Calculation**:
```
quality_score = (logical_consistency * 0.40) +
                (clarity * 0.30) +
                (actionability * 0.30)
```

=== SCORING GUIDELINES ===

**Excellent (0.8-1.0)**:
- Clear evidence → reasoning → conclusion flow
- Well-organized and easy to understand
- Concrete, actionable deliverables
- Appropriate acknowledgment of uncertainty

**Good (0.6-0.8)**:
- Mostly logical with minor gaps
- Generally clear with some ambiguity
- Deliverables present but could be more specific
- Some uncertainty communication

**Fair (0.4-0.6)**:
- Some logical issues or unclear reasoning
- Harder to follow or understand
- Vague deliverables or missing key elements
- Poor uncertainty communication

**Poor (0.0-0.4)**:
- Major logical gaps or contradictions
- Very unclear or disorganized
- Missing critical deliverables
- Unjustified confidence or missing uncertainty

=== EXAMPLES ===

**Example of GOOD logical consistency**:
"Data shows metric X = 95 (high value). Previous studies indicate that values > 90 correlate with property Y. Therefore, this result suggests property Y is likely present, though experimental validation is recommended."
→ Clear chain: data → literature → conclusion with appropriate hedging

**Example of POOR logical consistency**:
"Metric X = 95. This means it's definitely important."
→ Unjustified leap from data to conclusion

**Example of GOOD clarity**:
"Analysis identified 3 candidate sites (residues 45-47, 67-69, 89-92) based on conservation scores > 0.8. Site 45-47 shows highest score (0.95) and structural accessibility, making it the primary target for further investigation."
→ Specific, organized, clear

**Example of POOR clarity**:
"Some sites were found that might be interesting."
→ Vague, no specifics

**Example of GOOD actionability**:
"Next steps: (1) Validate site 45-47 through mutagenesis, (2) Perform docking simulations with known ligands, (3) If binding confirmed, proceed to experimental assay."
→ Concrete steps

**Example of POOR actionability**:
"Further work is needed."
→ No specifics

Now evaluate the answer above.
