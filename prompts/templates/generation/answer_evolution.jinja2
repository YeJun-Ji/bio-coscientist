You are a computational biology expert improving an existing research answer through evolution.
Your task is to create an IMPROVED version of the parent answer using the specified evolution method.

**IMPORTANT: ALL responses MUST be written in ENGLISH only. Do not use any other language.**

=== RESEARCH CONTEXT ===

**Problem Title**: {{ parsed_problem.title|default("Research Problem") }}

**Background**:
{{ parsed_problem.background|default("")|truncate(1000) }}

=== REQUIREMENT ===

**Requirement {{ requirement.requirement_id|default(requirement.step_id) }}: {{ requirement.title }}**

**Description**: {{ requirement.description }}

{% if requirement.expected_deliverables %}
**Expected Deliverables**:
{% for deliverable in requirement.expected_deliverables %}
- {{ deliverable }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

=== PARENT ANSWER TO EVOLVE ===

**Answer ID**: {{ parent_answer.id }}

**Current Answer**:
{{ parent_answer.answer }}

**Current Rationale**:
{{ parent_answer.rationale }}

**Current Deliverables**:
{{ parent_answer.deliverables|tojson(indent=2) }}

**Current Confidence**: {{ parent_answer.confidence }}

{% if parent_answer.review %}
**Review Feedback**:
{{ parent_answer.review|tojson(indent=2)|truncate(800) }}
{% endif %}

{% if context %}
=== CONFIRMED CONTEXT ===

{% for dep_id, dep_answer in context.items() %}
**Requirement {{ dep_id }}**: {{ dep_answer.answer|truncate(300) }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

=== EVOLUTION METHOD: {{ evolution_method|upper }} ===

{% if evolution_method == "grounding" %}
**GROUNDING EVOLUTION**
Improve the answer by:
- Adding more specific, concrete details
- Including exact values, sequences, or methods
- Reducing vagueness and generality
{% elif evolution_method == "coherence" %}
**COHERENCE EVOLUTION**
Improve the answer by:
- Better aligning with confirmed context
- Strengthening logical connections
- Ensuring consistency with dependencies
- Improving flow and clarity
{% elif evolution_method == "simplification" %}
**SIMPLIFICATION EVOLUTION**
Improve the answer by:
- Removing unnecessary complexity
- Focusing on core elements
- Making deliverables more achievable
- Increasing confidence through clarity
{% elif evolution_method == "divergent" %}
**DIVERGENT EVOLUTION**
Improve the answer by:
- Exploring alternative approaches
- Considering different methodologies
- Incorporating novel perspectives
- Challenging assumptions
{% else %}
**GENERAL IMPROVEMENT**
Improve the answer by:
- Addressing any weaknesses in the review
- Strengthening the rationale
- Improving deliverable quality
- Increasing overall confidence
{% endif %}

=== YOUR TASK ===

Create an EVOLVED version of the parent answer that is demonstrably better.

**Requirements:**
1. Must address weaknesses from the review (if available)
2. Must maintain consistency with confirmed context
3. Must provide all expected deliverables
4. Should show clear improvement over the parent answer
5. Explain what improvements were made

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

Respond with valid JSON only:

```json
{
  "requirement_id": "{{ requirement.requirement_id|default(requirement.step_id) }}",
  "evolution_method": "{{ evolution_method }}",
  "improvements": [
    "Specific improvement 1",
    "Specific improvement 2"
  ],
  "answer": "Evolved detailed answer (4-8 sentences). Must be better than parent.",
  "rationale": "Improved scientific reasoning (3-4 sentences)",
  "deliverables": {
    {% for deliverable in requirement.expected_deliverables|default([]) %}
    "{{ deliverable|lower|replace(' ', '_')|replace('-', '_') }}": "Improved output for: {{ deliverable }}"{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
  },
  "confidence": 0.80,
  "comparison_to_parent": "Brief explanation of why this is better than the parent answer"
}
```

=== CRITICAL GUIDELINES ===

1. **Be specific about improvements**: Don't just claim it's better, show it
2. **Maintain strengths**: Keep what was good about the parent
3. **Address weaknesses**: Fix issues mentioned in review
4. **Stay consistent**: Don't contradict confirmed context
5. **Confidence**: Should reflect actual improvement likelihood
