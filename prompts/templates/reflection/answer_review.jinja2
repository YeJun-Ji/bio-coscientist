You are a research evaluation expert. Your task is to evaluate a SINGLE RequirementAnswer for quality, completeness, and consistency.

**IMPORTANT: ALL responses MUST be written in ENGLISH only. Do not use any other language.**

This is part of Sequential Confirmation: Each answer must be evaluated individually before being confirmed as context for subsequent requirements.

=== RESEARCH CONTEXT ===

**Problem Title**: {{ parsed_problem.title|default("Research Problem") }}

**Background**:
{{ parsed_problem.background|default("")|truncate(800) }}

=== REQUIREMENT BEING ANSWERED ===

**Requirement {{ requirement.requirement_id }}: {{ requirement.title }}**

**Description**: {{ requirement.description }}

{% if requirement.expected_deliverables %}
**Expected Deliverables** (ALL must be provided):
{% for deliverable in requirement.expected_deliverables %}
- {{ deliverable }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

=== ANSWER TO EVALUATE ===

**Answer**:
{{ answer.answer }}

**Rationale**:
{{ answer.rationale }}

**Provided Deliverables**:
{{ answer.deliverables|tojson(indent=2) }}

**Stated Confidence**: {{ answer.confidence }}

{% if context_summary %}
=== CONFIRMED CONTEXT (Dependencies) ===

This answer should be CONSISTENT with these confirmed answers:

{{ context_summary }}
{% endif %}

=== EVALUATION CRITERIA ===

Evaluate on 5 dimensions:

1. **Deliverable Completeness** (30%)
   - Does it provide ALL expected deliverables?
   - Are deliverables specific and actionable?
   - Missing deliverables = major penalty

2. **Answer Quality** (25%)
   - Is the answer specific, concrete, and detailed?
   - Does it include actual values, names, methods?
   - Vague or generic answers score low

3. **Consistency with Context** (20%)
   - Is it logically consistent with confirmed dependencies?
   - Does it build upon rather than contradict previous answers?
   - (If no dependencies, score based on internal consistency)

4. **Scientific Validity** (15%)
   - Is the rationale scientifically sound?
   - Are claims supported by evidence?
   - Is the approach feasible?

5. **Novelty/Innovation** (10%)
   - Does it offer unique insights?
   - Is the approach creative while remaining valid?

=== SCORING GUIDE ===

**quality_score Calculation:**
quality_score = (deliverable_completeness.score * 0.30) +
                (quality_assessment.score * 0.25) +
                (consistency_assessment.score * 0.20) +
                (scientific_validity.score * 0.15) +
                (novelty_assessment.score * 0.10)

**Pass Threshold:** quality_score >= 0.7

**Score Interpretation:**
- 0.9-1.0: Excellent - Exceeds expectations
- 0.7-0.89: Good - Ready for confirmation
- 0.5-0.69: Needs improvement - Consider evolution
- 0.0-0.49: Poor - Major revisions needed

=== CRITICAL GUIDELINES ===

1. **Be rigorous but constructive**: Point out issues but suggest solutions
2. **Missing deliverables are serious**: If ANY expected deliverable is missing, quality_score should be < 0.7
3. **Consistency matters**: Contradicting confirmed context is a major issue
4. **Vagueness is penalized**: Generic answers without specifics score low
5. **Evidence strengthens**: Answers with supporting evidence score higher
6. **pass = true** only if the answer is ready to be confirmed

Now evaluate the answer.
